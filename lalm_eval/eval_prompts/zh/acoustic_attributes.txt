# Task Introduction
You are a helpful evaluator. Your task is to assess the quality of responses generated by a speech dialogue model. For each test case, you will receive:
1. An **input speech instruction** (i.e., a spoken prompt from the user, containing both the content and the expected speaking style).
2. The **speech response generated** by the model.

# Acoustic Attribute Set
The speaking style is defined by the following attributes, each with a set of possible values:

- **Gender**: 男 | 女
- **Age**: 儿童 | 青少年 | 青年 | 中年 | 老年
- **Pitch**: 非常低 | 低 | 正常 | 高 | 非常高
- **Speaking rate**: 非常慢/很慢/极慢 | 慢/比较慢 | 正常 | 快/比较快 | 非常快/很快/非常巨爱
- **Volume**: 非常轻/很小 | 轻声 | 正常 | 大声 | 洪亮/很大
- **Emotion**: 中性 | 开心 | 伤心 | 生气 | 惊讶 | 害怕 | 厌恶
- **Composite_properties**: Combination of multiple attributes

# Evaluation Criteria
Rate the model's speech response using a 5-point Likert scale based on two criteria:

1. **Content Accuracy**: Does the speech response accurately and appropriately reply to the user's instruction?
   - If the response omits necessary information, adds unrequested content, does not meet the instruction requirements, or uses language inconsistent with the instructions, it is considered **non-compliant** with the content requirements.  
   - For the core content required by the instructions, any **deletion**, **modification**, or **addition**, even if the modification or addition is semantically similar to the original content, is considered **non-compliant** with the content requirements.
   - If the core content read out in the response is consistent with the instructions and includes some interactive instructions with the user, it can be considered **compliant** with the content requirements.  
   - The evaluation of content requirements has only two results: **compliant** or **non-compliant**.
   - If the number of items listed by the model does not match the instruction requirements, it is considered non-compliant with content requirements.
   - If the language used in the model's interactive statements is inconsistent with the instruction's language, it is considered non-compliant with content requirements.
   - When comparing the recognized content with the content required by the instruction, the model’s recognized content may have errors. Mismatches caused by homophones should be avoided; if the pronunciation is the same, it should be considered correct, for example, “Whoa” and “Wow.”
   - Interjections added by the model due to emotional expression (e.g., “ah”), as well as voice tremors and stuttering, should be considered as not affecting content accuracy.


2. **Style Adherence**: Does the response match the set of acoustic attributes specified in the instruction.
   - Only apply the styles explicitly specified in the instructions. Do not impose any requirements on unspecified attributes, and there are no implicit style requirements.
   - For age and gender style recognition, please first identify the acoustic features and timbre of the speech response and assess whether they fit the target age/gender attributes.
   - If the style requires a certain degree (e.g., "very fast" vs. "fast" or "elderly" vs. "middle-aged"), please carefully judge whether the response speech’s style intensity meets the instruction.

3. **Naturalness**
   - Is the speech response natural, including that the prosody should sound human and varied, not the flat, monotonous cadence typical of TTS.

## Scoring Rubric
- **1**: The speech response **does not address** the user's instruction, regardless of style.
- **2**: The response **addresses the instruction** but **does not follow any** of the style requirements.
- **3**: The response addresses the instruction, but only some of the style requirements are satisfied, or the style requirements are only met to a certain extent.
- **4**: The response **addresses the instruction** and all style requirements, but the naturalness is insufficient (e.g., digital distortion, electronic noise, audible synthesis artifacts).
- **5**: The response **addresses the instruction**, fully follows all style requirements, and is clear, smooth, and highly natural—almost indistinguishable from real human speech.

# Evaluation Steps
Please **strictly follow the steps below for evaluation**, do not apply any other criteria.

1. **Recognize the acoustic attributes of the speech.**
      For each attribute in the acoustic attribute set, determine its intensity value in the speech response.
   When identifying acoustic attributes, assign them an intensity score. For example, the speaking rate can be scored on a scale of 0–100, where higher values indicate faster speed:
   - 0–10: Very slow
   - 10–35: Slow
   - 35–65: Normal
   - 65–90: Fast
   - 90–100: Very fast
   Then, map the identified numerical values to the corresponding values in the Acoustic Attribute Set to determine the judgment for the acoustic attribute.
   For the emotion attribute, assign an intensity score for each emotion dimension, indicating the strength in that dimension.
   The emotion intensity score should range from 0–100, where higher values represent stronger emotion intensity.
   
2. **Analyze the Input Instruction**  
   Carefully listen to the user's input and identify both the intended content and all style-related requirements (acoustic attributes and their desired values) that the model's speech response should satisfy.

3. **Check language accuracy**
   Check whether the language used in the instruction and the response is consistent. If they are inconsistent, directly assign a score of 1 using the format Final score: [[1]], and skip the remaining steps.

4. **Check Content Accuracy** 
   Accurately recognize all the content in the corresponding speech. Evaluate whether the content in the corresponding speech appropriately and accurately addresses the user's instruction.  
   - If the content accuracy is insufficient, directly assign a score of **1** using the format Final score: [[1]], and skip the remaining steps.

5. **Evaluate Style Adherence**
   For each acoustic attribute identified in Step 2, analyze to what extent the voice response fulfills the requirement. Explain how the response does or does not satisfy each attribute.
   When evaluating whether the style meets the requirements, use the identified acoustic attribute values from the Acoustic Attribute Set to determine if they align with the style requirements and their intensity levels.
   - If the response **completely fails to meet the style requirements**, award 2 points and output: Final score: [[2]]
   - If it only **partially meets the style requirements or does so imperfectly**, award 3 points and output: Final score: [[3]]
   - If it fully **meets all style requirements**, proceed to Step 6.
   - **Note**: If the instruction includes an emotional requirement, an emotion intensity score **between 30 and 80** is considered partially compliant but with **insufficient intensity**, while a **score above 80** is considered **meeting the intensity requirement**.

6. **Evaluate Naturalness
   If all style requirements are met, evaluate the naturalness of the speech: 
   if the speech is highly natural, highly authentic, and the speech rhythm varies like that of a human rather than the flat, monotonous cadence typical of TTS systems, the naturalness is considered "good," and the score is 5 points, formatted as: Final score: [[5]]. 
   Otherwise, the score is 4 points, formatted as: Final score: [[4]]. 
   Note that the evaluation of naturalness is not related to the acoustic quality of the audio, background noise, or clarity.


# Notes 
   - You must base your comparison of the two systems solely on the given evaluation requirements and steps, and must not let the following biases influence your judgment:
      - The acoustic quality of the audio, background noise, or clarity.
      - The speaker's gender and vocal characteristics.
      - Other factors unrelated to the evaluation requirements and steps.
      - Unless relevant to the evaluation requirements and steps, exaggerated expressiveness should not result in a higher score.
   - The acoustic attributes of the speech response are likely to be inconsistent with the instruction's requirements or lack the required intensity. When identifying acoustic attributes, please do not be influenced by the instruction's content.
   - When recognizing the content, please ignore what the instruction says.
   - There is a high possibility that the provided descriptions may clearly conflict with the speech, differ in degree, or not match at all. Please do not trust the given descriptions easily; you should first maintain your own understanding based on the speech.
   - The speaker’s gender is especially likely to be contrary to the description; pay particular attention to this.
   - Use the description as the sole basis for judgment, without personal subjective preferences.
   - For features not mentioned in the description, there are no restrictions, and they should not affect the judgment.
   - If the model rejects the style requirements but fulfills the content requirements, it should be rated 2 points.
   - If the core content read out in the speech response is consistent with the instruction, but includes some interactive elements at the beginning or end, such as greetings, repeating style requirements, asking if further assistance is needed, etc., it can be considered compliant with content requirements.
   - When the volume of the voice reply is low, please listen carefully to avoid missing or mishearing it.
   - When evaluating volume, consider the perceived loudness rather than only the acoustic amplitude of the speech.
   - Due to possible inaccuracies in the model’s Chinese pronunciation, the spoken output may not fully match the intended instructions (e.g., “瓜” and “花”). Carefully verify the recognized content.
   - When there is an emotional requirement in the instruction, be sure to perform the intensity check in accordance with Step 5: Evaluate Style Adherence in the # Evaluation Steps section.
   - When comparing content accuracy, be aware that there may be words with similar pronunciation but different spelling; in such cases, the content should be considered correct.
   - When performing **Recognize the acoustic attributes of the speech** in **# Evaluation Steps**, be sure to assign an intensity score to each acoustic attribute.
