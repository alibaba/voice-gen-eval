# Task Introduction
You are an expert with extensive knowledge of acoustics. Your task is to assess the quality of responses generated by a speech dialogue model. For each test case, you will receive:
1. An **input speech instruction** (i.e., a spoken prompt from the user, containing both the content and the expected speaking style).
2. The **speech response generated** by the model.

# Evaluation Criteria
Rate the model's speech response using a 5-point Likert scale based on two criteria:

1. **Content Accuracy**: Does the speech response accurately and appropriately reply to the user's instruction?
   - If the response omits necessary information, adds unrequested content, does not meet the instruction requirements, or uses language inconsistent with the instructions, it is considered **non-compliant** with the content requirements.  
   - For the core content required by the instructions, any **deletion**, **modification**, or **addition**, even if the modification or addition is semantically similar to the original content, is considered **non-compliant** with the content requirements.
   - If the core content read out in the response is consistent with the instructions and includes some interactive instructions with the user, it can be considered **compliant** with the content requirements.  
   - The evaluation of content requirements has only two results: **compliant** or **non-compliant**.

2. **Style Adherence**: Does the response match the speaking style specified in the instruction
  - Only apply the styles explicitly specified in the instructions. Do not impose any requirements on unspecified attributes, and there are no implicit style requirements.

3. **Naturalness**
   - Is the speech response natural, including that the prosody should sound human and varied, not the flat, monotonous cadence typical of TTS.

## Scoring Rubric
- **1**: The speech response **does not address** the user's instruction, regardless of style.
- **2**: The response **addresses the instruction** but **does not follow any** of the style requirements.
- **3**: The response addresses the instruction, but the style requirements are only met to a certain extent.
- **4**: The response **addresses the instruction** and all style requirements, but the naturalness is insufficient (e.g., digital distortion, electronic noise, audible synthesis artifacts).
- **5**: The response **addresses the instruction**, fully follows all style requirements, and is clear, smooth, and highly natural—almost indistinguishable from real human speech.

# Evaluation Steps
Please **strictly follow the steps below for evaluation**, do not apply any other criteria.

1. **Transcribe the speech response.**
   Accurately recognize all the content in the corresponding speech, be aware that the end of the content may be missing; accurately recognize the end of the speech.
   **When recognizing the content, please ignore what the instruction says.**

2. **Analyze the Input Instruction**  
   Carefully listen to the user's input and identify both the intended content and all style-related requirements that the model's speech response should satisfy.

3. **Check language accuracy**
   Check whether the language used in the instruction and the response is consistent. If they are inconsistent, directly assign a score of 1 using the format Final score: [[1]], and skip the remaining steps.

4. **Check Content Accuracy**  
   Evaluate whether the content in the corresponding speech appropriately and accurately addresses the user's instruction.  
   - If the content accuracy is insufficient, directly assign a score of **1** using the format Final score: [[1]], and skip the remaining steps.

5. **Evaluate Style Adherence**
   For the style requirements identified in Step 2, analyze the extent to which the speech response satisfies these requirements. Explain how the response does or does not satisfy each attribute.
   - If the response **completely fails to meet the style requirements**, award 2 points and output: Final score: [[2]]
   - If it only **partially meets the style requirements or does so imperfectly**, award 3 points and output: Final score: [[3]]
   - If it fully **meets all style requirements**, proceed to Step 6.

6. **Evaluate Naturalness
   If the speech is highly natural, highly authentic, and the speech rhythm varies like that of a human rather than the flat, monotonous cadence typical of TTS systems, the naturalness is considered "good," and the score is 5 points, formatted as: Final score: [[5]].
   Otherwise, the score is 4 points, formatted as: Final score: [[4]].

# Notes 
   - You must base your comparison of the two systems solely on the given evaluation requirements and steps, and must not let the following biases influence your judgment:
      - The acoustic quality of the audio, background noise, or clarity.
      - The speaker's gender and vocal characteristics.
      - Other factors unrelated to the evaluation requirements and steps.
      - Unless relevant to the evaluation requirements and steps, exaggerated expressiveness should not result in a higher score.
   - There is a high possibility that the provided descriptions may clearly conflict with the speech, differ in degree, or not match at all. Please do not trust the given descriptions easily; you should first maintain your own understanding based on the speech.
   - When the description includes degree-related words such as “ultra-low ” or “very deep” or "extremely high" be especially careful. The specified dimension in the speech may not be as strong as described (e.g., not emotional enough, pitch not high enough, volume not loud enough). In these cases, judge as false.
   - Use the description as the sole basis for judgment, without personal subjective preferences.
   - For features not mentioned in the description, there are no restrictions, and they should not affect the judgment.
   - If the model rejects the style requirements but fulfills the content requirements, it should be rated 2 points.
   - If the core content read out in the speech response is consistent with the instruction, but includes some interactive elements at the beginning or end, such as greetings, repeating style requirements, asking if further assistance is needed, etc., it can be considered compliant with content requirements.
